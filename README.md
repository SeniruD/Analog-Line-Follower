# Analog-Line-Follower (EN2090 - Laboratory Practice - II Project)
Analog Line Follower is the project we did for the Laboratory Practice II module. The objective of this project is to designing a robot which follows white line or a trace on a black surface. This should navigate the curvy paths very smoothly and stop at a white line perpendicular to the path.
